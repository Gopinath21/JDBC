DDL:common cmds
Create table;
drop table;
alter table;
DML : Common cmds,
select, update, instert, & delete.
javax.sql package is used for Enterprise applcaitions, EJBS;
EJBS : used to buid & deploys o-o & distributed enterprise appls.
J2SE 1.4 : have JDBC 3.0 . JDBC 3.0=java.sql, javax.sql;
jdbc2.1 API ;
consists of two apis-
the core api and the jdbc optional package api.
Core Api = java.sql without javax.sql.
Optional APi = javax.sql without java.sql;
JDBC 3.0 = have both 
packages as core.
jDBC=used for open connetions , excute the SQL stmts , process the results..

Performance imporemets:-
1) Connection pooling
2) Data caching 
Transtation :
A set of squence of SQL stmts & performs one LUW.
LUW= logical unit of work.
===
=>Connection mgmtnt :=The JDBC DataSource & ConnectionPoolDataSource interfaces enables applicaiton components to connect to back-end systems.
==Transaction mgmt:=
The JDBC XADataSource interface allows applcations to access rescources & databases.
===Security mgmt:=
the JDBC API does not contain interfaces that enables secure access . However , the JDBC API can be mapped to the J2EE Connector architecture;'s SPI ; and this will ensure
that applcaitons have secure access to back -end systems.

Choosing the JDBC driver:
1) Architecture
2) Data -access requirements of applicaition.
Type 4 : driver is most suitable driver for the use in a two-tier applcaitons .
2-tier arch support drivers are :- 
type 1 , type 2 , type 3 .
But we should select either type 2 or type 4 b/c to get the all functionality of the target database.
type1 not provide the 
all of the functionality of DB . type 1 not support proprietaty SQL stmts.
type 3 is not sutable for 2 -tiiers b/c it requrite remoteserver.
